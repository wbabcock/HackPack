#  Go Source for CrunchLabs HackPack (Unofficial)

This is unofficial source code for the HackPack subscription box for https://www.crunchlabs.com/.

It is all written TinyGo to test the capabilities of the language as well as a learning path for myself to get a deeper understanding of Go. The first folder is 00 - Blinky just to ensure the setup between the computer and microsontroller is working.
